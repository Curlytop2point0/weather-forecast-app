# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. This project aims to enhance my understanding of JavaScript and its application in web development. I developed a weather forecast web application to demonstrate my ability to work with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.

The software fetches and displays weather forecasts based on user-entered locations. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and present it in a user-friendly format. Users can search for weather information by entering a city name, and the application displays the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and a 5-day forecast.

The purpose of writing this software is to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript, improve my coding skills, and learn how to integrate external APIs into a web application.

# Development Environment

- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, GitHub
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Libraries**: OpenWeatherMap API

# Useful Websites

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [OpenWeatherMap API Documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api)

# Future Work

- Add functionality to display a 5-day weather forecast using ES6 array functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Implement a recursive function to enhance the application's features.
- Improve the user interface and make it more interactive with additional CSS and JavaScript animations.

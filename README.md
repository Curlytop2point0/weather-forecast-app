# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. This project is designed to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and its application in web development. My name is Maxim Person and I created a weather forecast web application to showcase my ability to work with APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript.

The application I created fetches and displays weather forecasts based on user-inputted locations. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, it retrieves weather data and presents it in an intuitive format. Users can search for weather information by entering a city name, and the application displays the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and a 5-day forecast.

The purpose of developing this software is to gain practical experience with JavaScript, enhance my coding skills, and learn how to integrate external APIs into a web application.

# Development Environment

- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, GitHub
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Libraries**: OpenWeatherMap API

# Useful Websites
- [Collections in Java with Example Programs](https://beginnersbook.com/java-collections-tutorials/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

# Future Work

- Add functionality to display a 5-day weather forecast using ES6 array functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Implement a recursive function to enhance the application's features.
- Improve the user interface and make it more interactive with additional CSS and JavaScript animations.
